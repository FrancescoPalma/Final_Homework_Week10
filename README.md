Java OO Farm

Task 1: MVP - Farm Setup (50% DONE)

Create a farm consisting of a number of animals of your choice. Each animal should be defined in its own class.

Animals can be fed, bought and sold on the farm by the farmer. These animals should be stored in a collection.

Task 2: Extension - Determine Crop Yield (NOT DONE)

You may decide to have farmland that can be used for crops or set aside for another purpose.

Crops can be harvested to provide a yield.

Your farm should be intialised with a fixed number of fields with different types of crops and there should be an option to calculate the total yield for a field and for the farm.

You may decide to attach a price to each crop and to be able to caluclate the potential yield of a farm by accepting a Farm as a parameter.

If you have time, you might want to extend your fram to cope with fluctuations in season, eg. good season/bad season and update the predicted yield accordingly.
